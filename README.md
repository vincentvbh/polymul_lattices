## Intended role of this repository

## Structure of this repository

## Software requirements
That's simple. You just need to compile `C` programs.
Since I use `Makefile`, below are the requirements for running the examples:
- `make`
- `gcc`/`clang`

In general, you just need to figure out how to compile `C` programs in your environment.
